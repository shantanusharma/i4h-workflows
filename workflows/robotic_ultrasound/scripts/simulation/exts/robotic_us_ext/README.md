# Robotic US Extension

## Environments

Isaac-Lab scripts usually receive a `--task <task_name>` argument. This argument is used to select the environment/task to be run.
These tasks are detected by the `gym.register` function in the [robotic_us_ext/\__init__.py](robotic_us_ext/tasks/ultrasound/approach/config/franka/__init__.py).

These registered tasks are then further defined in the [environment configuration file](robotic_us_ext/tasks/ultrasound/approach/config/franka/franka_manager_rl_env_cfg.py).

Available tasks:

- `Isaac-Teleop-Torso-FrankaUsRs-IK-RL-Rel-v0`: FrankaUsRs with relative actions
- `Isaac-Reach-Torso-FrankaUsRs-IK-RL-Abs-v0` : FrankaUsRs with absolute actions

Currently there are these robot configurations that can be used in various tasks

| Robot name                                 | task             | applications          |
|----------                                  |---------         |----------             |
| FRANKA_PANDA_REALSENSE_ULTRASOUND_CFG      | \*-FrankaUsRs-*  | Reach, Teleop         |
