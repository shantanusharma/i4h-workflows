# Contributing to NVIDIA Isaac for Healthcare

## License Guidelines

- Make sure that you can contribute your work to open source. Verify that no license and/or patent conflict is introduced by your code. NVIDIA is not responsible for conflicts resulting from community contributions.

- We require community submissions under the Apache 2.0 permissive open source license, which is the [default for Isaac for Healthcare](./LICENSE).

- We require that members [sign](#signing-your-contribution) their contributions to certify their work.

### Coding Guidelines

- All source code contributions must strictly adhere to the Isaac for Healthcare coding style.

### Signing Your Contribution

- We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

- Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

- To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:

  ```bash
  git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```

  This will append the following to your commit message:

  ```text
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```

## Pre-commit Hooks

We use pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality. To set up pre-commit:

1. Install pre-commit:

   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   ```

2. To check your code before committing:

   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

3. To automatically fix linting and formatting errors:

   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

## Running Tests
